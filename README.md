#This repository includes the code for the Corner Grocer program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
#The project was to design a program that prints the frequency of a purchased item as well as printing a histogram to display the frequency.

What did you do particularly well?
#I think the main function was done well, but that was the easiest part for me to accomplish. I struggled to code the classes for finding the items and reading and writing the file, but my code ending up working, so I'm happy that it worked out.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
#If I could enhance my code, I would probably create more classes so that the code would run more efficiently, and looked more organized.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
#Creating the classes were the hardest part of this project. I had a hard time conceptualizing this project and how to actually make it a program. I used resources online for C++ to try to figure out how to design the program to work how I needed it to.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
#I think being able to grasp the concept of different languages will come easier to me after this course. Java and C++ are very similar, and I felt more confident learning C++ since I had a grasp on Java. In my job, I use C#, and I feel more confident looking at C# since I've had more experience with OOP languages.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
#I made this program more readable and adaptable by organizing the functions of the programs. When I was initially working on it, it was messy, all over the place, and buggy. After making some adjustments on where some of the code actually was, it functioned a lot better and looks more organized.
